# Lostheavy

Thanks to the Covid-19 panic, I've been compelled to take vacation. "An idle mind is the devil's workshop" or something like that... best that I keep busy with this small fitness tracking project where I can work with Docker, Postgresql, GraphQL API, Keycloak for identity / access management and a yet to be determined (probably Angular) Typescript base frontend that will cross compile to web/ios/android clients.

What follows is a learning exercise where I delve into some techs I don't normally get to use.

Work in progress...
